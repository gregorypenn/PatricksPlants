# PatricksPlants

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of PatricksPlants is to make Patrick Alexander's plant occurance observations more accessible for analysis. A data frame is provided with all observations and metadata coded as presence-only. Presence-absence data may reasonably be infered from this and a function is provided to do so on a per-species basis.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of PatricksPlants from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("PatricksPlants") -->
<!-- ``` -->

You can install the development version of PatricksPlants from GitHub with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gregorypenn/PatricksPlants")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(PatricksPlants)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
